## About the Project


**Moto Contest** is a client-server desktop application for managing motocross races and participants. The original version is implemented in Java, and a parallel implementation is available in C# using .NET 9. 
Users can authenticate, search for races and participants, and assign participants to teams. This project uses SQLite for persistent storage, and Sockets for communication between the client and server.

This application demonstrates the use of **SQLite**, and **multi-threaded socket programming**.
